# Hammerspoon 

Everyone should have this tool: https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon

Even though I used to be a Lua dev fulltime, i'm rusty, so I use the tools here to run my tasks from bash. 

- Copy hinit.lua to ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua
- Reload hammerspoon config
- Create a 700 ~/wakeywaky file
	- Add whatever 

Every time your mac wakes up, it'll run wakeywakey .
